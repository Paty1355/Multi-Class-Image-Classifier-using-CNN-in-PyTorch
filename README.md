# Multi-Class Image Classifier using CNN in PyTorch

## Overview
This project implements a multi-class image classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of grayscale images and evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## Features
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a single convolutional layer.
- Uses `ReLU` activation and `MaxPool2d` for feature extraction.
- Fully connected (`Linear`) layer for classification.
- Trained using the Adam optimizer and `CrossEntropyLoss`.
- Evaluates performance with `Accuracy`, `Precision`, and `Recall`.
